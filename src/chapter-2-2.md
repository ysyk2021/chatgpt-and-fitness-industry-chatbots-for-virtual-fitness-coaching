The introduction of wearable technology, such as fitness trackers and smartwatches, in the mid-2010s added another layer of data collection and analysis to virtual coaching. Coaches and clients could track and analyze fitness metrics and use that data to inform their coaching and workouts.

Advancements in Artificial Intelligence

Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the development of AI-powered virtual coaching. Coaches and clients can now rely on algorithms to provide personalized recommendations and support based on client data, such as fitness goals and preferences.
